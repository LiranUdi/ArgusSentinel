# Sentinel
*Advanced Windows Process Monitoring and Behavioral Analysis Tool*

## Overview
Sentinel is a sophisticated Windows process monitoring tool written in Go that provides real-time visibility into process creation, termination, and modifications. It's designed for security professionals and system administrators who need detailed insights into system behavior.

## Current Features

### Core Monitoring
- Real-time process creation and termination detection
- Process modification tracking
- Parent-child process relationship mapping

### Detection Capabilities
Monitors changes in:
- Command line arguments
- Thread count fluctuations
- Memory usage patterns
- Handle count variations
- Working directory modifications

### Event Handling
- Real-time alerting system
- Detailed process information capture
- Timestamped event logging

## Planned Features

### Web Interface
- Real-time process tree visualization
- Interactive process details view
- Historical event timeline
- Metric dashboards

### Advanced Monitoring
- Process exclusion rules
- Custom filtering capabilities
- Enhanced detection techniques
  - DLL injection detection
  - Memory region modifications
  - Suspicious thread creation patterns
  - Network connection monitoring

### Analysis Features
- Process behavior baselining
- Anomaly detection
- Custom rule creation
- Alert prioritization

## Installation

```bash
git clone [your-repository]
cd sentinel
go build
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic monitoring
./sentinel

# With debug logging
./sentinel -debug

# Specify custom config file
./sentinel -config config.yaml
```

## Architecture
Sentinel is built with a modular architecture:
- Process Collector: Handles Windows API interactions
- Event Manager: Processes and routes system events
- Alert System: Manages notification and logging
- Monitor Core: Orchestrates system components
